# Phase A Completion Notes

**Date:** 2026-03-20
**Summary:** Built the hook infrastructure for design-approval-triggered acceptEdits mode. Created two bash hook scripts (`post-tool-use-design-approval.sh` and `permission-request-accept-edits.sh`), their test suites (13 tests, 16 assertions all passing), `hooks/hooks.json` wiring both hooks into the Claude Code plugin system, updated `marketplace.json` to add the hooks field to the two workflow plugins, updated `skills/design/SKILL.md` to replace the verbal approval step with a structured AskUserQuestion gate that includes machine-readable metadata and plan dir path, and bumped all three plugin versions from 1.6.0 to 1.7.0.
**Deviations:** None — plan followed exactly.
