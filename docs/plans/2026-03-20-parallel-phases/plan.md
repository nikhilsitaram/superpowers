# Enable parallel phase execution via per-phase worktrees and integration branches Implementation Plan

> **For Claude:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use orchestrate

**Goal:** Enable parallel phase execution via per-phase worktrees and integration branches
**Architecture:** Extend plan.json schema with workflow routing and phase-level depends_on. Update validate-plan for new fields and cycle detection. Update design, draft-plan, orchestrate, ship, and merge-pr skills to use integration branch model with per-phase worktrees. Add DAG-based wave dispatch for concurrent phase execution.
**Tech Stack:** Bash (validate-plan script), Markdown (SKILL.md files), jq, git worktree, gh CLI

## Phase A — Schema, Routing, and Integration Branch Model
**Status:** Not Started | **Rationale:** Foundation layer: schema validation, workflow routing, and the integration branch model must exist before Phase B can add parallel dispatch on top. All skill updates in this phase switch to the integration branch model with sequential phase dispatch.

- [x] A1: Add workflow and phase depends_on validation to validate-plan — *validate-plan --schema validates workflow enum (ship|review-only|plan-only), phase-level depends_on arrays (valid letters only, backward references), and detects circular phase dependencies; all new schema tests pass*
- [x] A2: Update test fixture for new schema fields — *Valid plan fixture includes workflow field and phase depends_on arrays; all test suites pass with updated fixture*
- [x] A3: Update draft-plan SKILL.md for workflow and phase depends_on — *draft-plan SKILL.md documents workflow field (ship|review-only|plan-only) in plan.json example and fields table; phase-level depends_on documented in plan.json example with explanation; word count remains under 1000*
- [x] A4: Update design SKILL.md for integration branch and workflow routing — *Design SKILL.md step 7 uses .claude/worktrees/<feature>/ path and integrate/<feature> branch naming; new step after draft-plan asks user about workflow preference (ship/review-only/plan-only) and writes it to plan.json; word count remains under 1000*
- [ ] A5: Add --base argument to ship SKILL.md — *Ship SKILL.md Arguments table includes --base <branch> argument; Step 8 (Create PR) uses gh pr create --base when --base is provided, defaults to $DEFAULT_BRANCH when omitted; word count remains under 1000*
- [ ] A6: Update orchestrate SKILL.md for integration branch model — *Orchestrate SKILL.md reads workflow field from plan.json and routes accordingly (ship/review-only/plan-only); uses integration branch naming (integrate/<feature>); creates per-phase worktrees at .claude/worktrees/<feature>-phase-{letter}/; ships phase PRs with --base integrate/<feature>; final PR targets main; PRIOR_COMPLETIONS scoped to transitive depends_on closure; word count remains under 1000*
- [ ] A7: Update phase-dispatcher-prompt.md for integration branch PR targeting — *Phase dispatcher prompt notes that {REPO_PATH} is the phase worktree path (not main repo); prior completions scoped to dependency chain (not all prior phases); no other behavioral changes*

## Phase B — Parallel Dispatch and Merge Flow
**Status:** Not Started | **Rationale:** Builds on Phase A's integration branch model to add concurrent phase execution. Requires the schema, worktree layout, and integration branch conventions from Phase A to be in place.

- [ ] B1: Add DAG wave logic for parallel phase dispatch to orchestrate — *Orchestrate SKILL.md includes DAG construction from phase depends_on; wave-based dispatch loop (identify ready phases, dispatch in parallel, process completions serially); example workflow shows diamond dependency (A->B+C->D) with parallel B+C dispatch; sequential plans degrade gracefully*
- [ ] B2: Add rebase-before-merge step for parallel phases to orchestrate — *Orchestrate SKILL.md documents rebase step after each parallel phase completes: rebase phase branch on latest integration, trivial conflicts (no markers) proceed with test verification, non-trivial conflicts (markers present) pause for user; serialized completion processing prevents race conditions*
- [ ] B3: Update merge-pr SKILL.md for final integration-to-main merge — *Merge-pr SKILL.md handles integration branch PRs: detects integrate/<feature> branch pattern; cleanup removes all phase worktrees (.claude/worktrees/<feature>-phase-*) and integration worktree (.claude/worktrees/<feature>); deletes integration branch and phase branches; word count remains under 1000*
- [ ] B4: Bump marketplace.json version — *All three plugin entries in marketplace.json have version bumped from 1.6.0 to 1.7.0*
