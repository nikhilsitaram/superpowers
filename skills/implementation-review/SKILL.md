# Implementation Review

Per-task reviews verify each piece works. This review verifies the pieces work **together**.

## When to Use

- After all tasks complete in orchestrate (auto-dispatched)
- Before merging any multi-task feature branch
- Between phases of a multi-phase plan (auto-dispatched by orchestrate after each phase)
- When asked to "review the whole thing" or "look at everything with fresh eyes"

## Pre-Flight Checks

Before dispatching the reviewer:

1. **Run integration tests** — The first task's broad acceptance tests and boundary tests at cross-task seams should all pass. If any fail, fix before proceeding.
2. **Fill gaps** — if any cross-task boundary lacks a test, write one now.

Skip if: single-module change or purely additive tasks with no interactions.

## How to Dispatch

Use `./reviewer-prompt.md` template with these variables:

| Variable | Value |
|----------|-------|
| `{BASE_SHA}` | Phase start SHA (`PHASE_BASE_SHA` from orchestrate) — scopes diff to current phase only |
| `{HEAD_SHA}` | `git rev-parse HEAD` — current tip |
| `{FEATURE_SUMMARY}` | What the feature does (1-2 sentences) |
| `{TASK_LIST}` | Extract from plan.json: `jq '.phases[N].tasks[] \| .id + ": " + .name'` |
| `{PLAN_DIR}` | Path to plan directory |
| `{PHASE_DIR}` | Path to current phase directory |
| `{REPO_PATH}` | Repository root path |
| `{PHASE_CONTEXT}` | Phase letter and name (e.g., "Phase A of C: Core API"), and what downstream phases expect (interfaces, config, APIs). Empty string for final/single-phase reviews. |
| `{DESIGN_DOC_PATH}` | Path to design doc (from plan frontmatter, or "None") |

**Use `model: "opus"`** — fresh-eyes review requires the strongest reasoning to catch subtle cross-task issues.

**Use the full diff range** — `BASE_SHA..HEAD_SHA` must cover ALL tasks, not just the last one.

**Phase-scoped reviews:** For inter-phase reviews, `BASE_SHA` is the commit before the phase's first task — not `git merge-base origin/main`. This scopes the diff to only the current phase's changes.

## What It Catches

| Category | Example |
|----------|---------|
| Cross-task inconsistency | Config says port 3000, README says 8080 |
| Duplicated constants | Same timeout defined in two modules |
| Code duplication | Identical function in two files |
| Dead code from iteration | Conditional where both branches are identical |
| Documentation gaps | Feature supported but undocumented |
| Inconsistent errors | Same generic error from multiple locations |
| Missing boundary tests | Components interact but no integration test |
| Unmet success criteria | Design says "users can X" but implementation doesn't deliver it |

## Post-Review: Plan Doc Updates

After review passes, the **orchestrator** updates the plan document:

1. **Document fixups** — append `### Implementation Review Changes` to `phase-{letter}/completion.md` listing each change. Omit if no fixups needed.

2. **Handoff notes (multi-phase only)** — if future phases exist, the dispatcher has already written inline handoff notes on target tasks. The orchestrator verifies these are accurate post-review and updates if review changes affected interfaces.

## Re-Review Gate

If the reviewer finds more than 5 fix-needed issues: after all fixes are applied, dispatch a fresh reviewer subagent with the same full review scope. This catches reviewer hallucination from compounding and new issues introduced by bulk fixes.

Under 5 issues, the orchestrator verifies fixes and proceeds without re-review.

## Integration

**Auto-dispatched by:** orchestrate (after all tasks complete)

**Leads to:** create-pr (once review passes)
