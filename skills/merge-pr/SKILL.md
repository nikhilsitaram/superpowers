# Merge PR

Address review feedback, comment on the PR, merge with squash, and clean up.

**Prerequisite:** A PR created by `/ship`.

**Review principle:** Verify each suggestion against the codebase before implementing. Push back on incorrect ones with technical reasoning — no performative agreement.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Setup

Identify the PR from argument, current branch (`gh pr view`), or `gh pr list --author @me --state open`. If the list returns multiple candidates and you're not on a branch with an associated PR, ask the user to pick. Store PR number, branch name, and URL.

Detect environment:
- `DEFAULT_BRANCH` from `refs/remotes/origin/HEAD` (fallback: main/master)
- `MAIN_REPO` from `git rev-parse --path-format=absolute --git-common-dir` (strip `/.git`)
- `IS_WORKTREE` — true when `--git-dir` differs from `--git-common-dir`
- `WORKTREE_PATH` — look up from `git worktree list` by matching `$BRANCH_NAME` (works regardless of CWD)
- `IS_INTEGRATION` — true when `$BRANCH_NAME` matches `integrate/*`; extract `FEATURE=${BRANCH_NAME#integrate/}`

If not on the PR branch: look up `WORKTREE_PATH` first — if the branch is in a worktree, `cd` into it (`gh pr checkout` fails when a worktree holds the branch). Otherwise `gh pr checkout $PR_NUMBER`.

### Step 2: PR Review

Skip if `--skip-review` was passed.

Read `reviewer-prompt.md` (same directory as SKILL.md) and dispatch a fresh-eyes reviewer subagent with:
- `{DIFF_RANGE}` = `$DEFAULT_BRANCH..HEAD`
- `{REPO_PATH}` = repository root path
- `{PR_NUMBER}` = PR number from Step 1

The subagent posts its findings as a `gh pr comment` on the PR (visible audit trail), then returns findings for use in Step 3.

### Step 3: Collect & Assess All Feedback

Fetch PR conversation comments, inline review comments, and review status via `gh`.

Merge subagent findings (Step 2) with external comments. If Step 2 was skipped, process external only. Evaluate each on merit.

Categorize each item:

| Category | Action |
|----------|--------|
| **Actionable fix** — bug, security, correctness | Fix it |
| **Suggestion** — style, refactor, nice-to-have | Evaluate: fix if it improves correctness/readability, dismiss with reason if not |
| **Informational** — explanation, praise | Acknowledge, no change |
| **False positive** — incorrect analysis | Dismiss with technical reasoning |

### Step 4: Present & Confirm

Show the user a summary table with source, category, planned action, and counts per category.

Use AskUserQuestion with options:
- **Fix all** — actionable + suggestion items (excludes dismissed/false positives)
- **Fix critical only** — actionable items (bugs, security, correctness)
- **Skip fixes, merge as-is** — jump to Step 7
- **Other** — user provides custom instructions (e.g. "fix items 1, 3, 5")

### Step 5: Fix, Test, Push

If `--skip-fixes` was passed, skip this entire step.

For each actionable item: make the fix. Run project tests — do not merge with failing tests. Commit and push with `git push -u origin HEAD`.

### Step 6: Comment on PR

Post a `gh pr comment` with unified assessment: what was fixed, dismissed (with reasons), and no-action. Omit empty sections.

### Step 7: Confirm Merge

Show: PR URL, number of fixes applied, any dismissed items.

Use AskUserQuestion with options:
- **Merge** — proceed with squash merge
- **Abort** — stop without merging

### Step 8: Merge

If branch protection requires human approval and the PR lacks it, tell the user and stop with the PR URL.

**Pre-merge rebase check:** Before merging, verify the PR branch is up-to-date with the default branch:

```bash
git fetch origin $DEFAULT_BRANCH
git merge-base --is-ancestor origin/$DEFAULT_BRANCH HEAD
```

If behind (non-zero exit): rebase onto default branch, resolve conflicts, run tests, push with `git push -u origin HEAD --force-with-lease`. Always use `origin HEAD` explicitly — worktrees lose upstream tracking after rebase, so bare `git push` fails. Comment on PR with conflict resolution details. Complex conflicts → stop and ask user.

**CWD safety:** Always `cd "$MAIN_REPO"` before merging — merge triggers remote branch deletion which bricks the shell if CWD is inside the worktree.

```bash
cd "$MAIN_REPO"
gh pr merge $PR_NUMBER --squash
```

Never use `--delete-branch` — branch cleanup is handled in Step 9.

### Step 9: Clean Up

Run each sub-step as a SEPARATE Bash tool call — CWD changes don't persist across chained `&&`.

Derive `WORKTREE_PATH` if not already captured (exact branch match):
```bash
git worktree list --porcelain | awk -v b="refs/heads/$BRANCH_NAME" '$1=="worktree"{wt=$2} $1=="branch" && $2==b{print wt; exit}'
```

**Integration branch** (`IS_INTEGRATION=true`): run each as separate Bash call:
1. For each phase worktree `.claude/worktrees/$FEATURE-phase-*`: `git worktree remove <path>`
2. `git worktree remove .claude/worktrees/$FEATURE`
3. Delete phase branches: `git branch -D phase-a phase-b ...` (list from plan.json)
4. `git branch -D $BRANCH_NAME`
5. `git worktree prune` → `git pull --rebase` → `git remote prune origin`

**Standard worktree:**
1. `git worktree remove "$WORKTREE_PATH"` (retry `--force` if untracked files)
2. `git branch -D $BRANCH_NAME`
3. `git worktree prune` → `git pull --rebase` → `git remote prune origin`

**Not in a worktree:** `git checkout $DEFAULT_BRANCH` → `git branch -D $BRANCH_NAME` → `git pull --rebase` → `git remote prune origin`

### Step 10: Summary

Report: PR number/URL, review items (fixed/dismissed/informational), merge status, cleanup status.

## Arguments

| Arg | Effect |
|-----|--------|
| `<PR number>` | Target specific PR (`/merge-pr 42`) |
| *(none)* | Detect from current branch |
| `--skip-review` / `-R` | Skip subagent review (Step 2) — external feedback still processed |
| `--skip-fixes` / `-S` | Skip fixing — just comment, merge, clean up |

## Pitfalls

| Mistake | Why |
|---------|-----|
| Merging while CWD is inside worktree | Remote branch deletion bricks the shell. `cd "$MAIN_REPO"` before merge. |
| Chaining Step 9 with `&&` | CWD change doesn't persist if later command fails. Use separate Bash calls. |
| Deleting branch before removing worktree | Git refuses. Remove worktree first. |
| Using `--delete-branch` on `gh pr merge` | Fails in worktree flows. Delete branch manually after. |
| Blindly implementing review suggestions | Verify each against the codebase, push back on incorrect ones. |
| Merging without commenting | Always post what was addressed before merging. |
