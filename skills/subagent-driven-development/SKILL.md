# Subagent-Driven Development

Execute plan by dispatching fresh subagent per task, with two-stage review after each: spec compliance review first, then code quality review.

**Core principle:** Fresh subagent per task + two-stage review (spec then quality) = high quality, fast iteration

## When to Use

- Have an implementation plan with mostly independent tasks
- Tasks can be dispatched one at a time to fresh subagents
- Don't use for tightly coupled tasks or when no plan exists

## The Process

**Per task:** Dispatch implementer → spec compliance review → code quality review → mark complete

**After all tasks:** Write completion report → verify Task 0 integration tests pass → implementation review → ship

## Prompt Templates

| Template | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `./implementer-prompt.md` | Dispatch implementer subagent |
| `./spec-reviewer-prompt.md` | Spec compliance reviewer |
| `./code-quality-reviewer-prompt.md` | Code quality reviewer |
| `skills/implementation-review/reviewer-prompt.md` | Final implementation reviewer |

## Example Workflow

```text
[Read plan once, extract all tasks, create TaskCreate for each]

Task 0: Broad integration tests
[Dispatch implementer] → Creates failing tests + stubs, commits
[Spec + code review pass] → Mark complete

Task 1: Hook installation
[Dispatch implementer]
Implementer: "Should hook be user or system level?"
You: "User level (~/.config/)"
Implementer: Implemented, 5/5 tests pass, committed
[Spec review: ✅] → [Code review: ✅] → Mark complete

Task 2: Recovery modes
[Dispatch implementer] → Implemented, 8/8 tests pass
[Spec review: ❌ Missing progress reporting, extra --json flag]
[Implementer fixes] → [Spec review: ✅]
[Code review: ❌ Magic number]
[Implementer extracts constant] → [Code review: ✅]
Mark complete

[After all tasks]
[Verify Task 0 tests now GREEN]
[Implementation review] → Found duplicated constant
[Fix] → [Implementation review: ✅]
[Auto-invoke ship → PR created]
```

**Integration test levels:** Task 0 provides broad acceptance tests (Level 1). Implementers write boundary tests at cross-task seams (Level 2). Implementation-review verifies coverage (Level 3).

## Deviation Rules

When reality diverges from the plan:

| Rule | Trigger | Action |
|------|---------|--------|
| **Rule 1: Auto-fix bugs** | Code doesn't work as intended | Fix inline, document |
| **Rule 2: Auto-add critical** | Missing error handling, validation, auth | Fix inline, document |
| **Rule 3: Auto-fix blockers** | Missing dep, broken import, wrong types | Fix inline, document |
| **Rule 4: STOP** | New DB table, library swap, breaking API | **Ask user first** |

**Scope:** Only auto-fix issues caused by current task. Pre-existing issues go to a deferred list.

**Limit:** After 3 fix attempts on same issue, stop and document.

**Documentation:** Every Rule 1-3 deviation must include: what deviated, what was done, which rule applied.

## Plan Doc Updates

Update the plan document as execution progresses:

| When | Update |
|------|--------|
| First task starts | Frontmatter: `status: In Development` |
| Task completes | Change `- [ ] Task N` to `- [x] Task N` |
| All tasks done | Append `## Completion Report` with summary + deviations |
| Implementation-review passes | Phase status: `Complete (YYYY-MM-DD)` |

## Implementation Review

After completion report written and Task 0 tests pass GREEN:

1. Get `BASE_SHA` (merge-base) and `HEAD_SHA`
2. Dispatch reviewer using `skills/implementation-review/reviewer-prompt.md`
3. If issues found → fix → re-dispatch until clean
4. Update phase status to Complete

## Key Constraints

| Constraint | Why |
|------------|-----|
| One implementer at a time | Parallel implementers cause git conflicts |
| Provide full task text | Reading plan wastes subagent context |
| Spec compliance before code quality | Code review is wasted if spec is wrong |
| Answer questions before proceeding | Assumptions produce rework |

## Integration

**Workflow:** using-git-worktrees (before) → writing-plans (creates plan) → **this skill** → implementation-review → ship → merge-pr (after CodeRabbit)

**Subagents use:** test-driven-development
