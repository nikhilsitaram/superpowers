# stopfailure-resume.sh — StopFailure hook (matcher: rate_limit) breadcrumb for
# /usage-guard --queue.
#
# usage-guard's main job is to STOP cleanly at the threshold (default 99%). The
# check is checkpoint-granular, though, so one oversized action can trip a real
# rate limit before the next check — Claude Code then fires a StopFailure hook
# with matcher `rate_limit`. This hook is a light breadcrumb: it does NOT try to
# auto-resume (a hook is a plain shell process — it can't create a CronCreate job,
# and the payload carries no reset time anyway). It just records that an active
# `--queue` run was interrupted, so the next `/usage-guard` run can offer to pick
# the work back up instead of it being silently lost.
#
# It NO-OPS unless a `--queue` run is active (the guard-marker.sh marker is
# present), so it is safe to leave registered. OPT-IN: wire it into settings.json
# yourself (a plugin can't edit settings.json) — see ../README.md.
#
# Config (env): the marker/breadcrumb live beside the usage state, so resolve the
# SAME directory the wrapper/consumers use — a non-empty QUEUE_STATE_FILE pins the
# state (they ignore QUEUE_STATE_DIR then), so its dirname wins; otherwise
# QUEUE_STATE_DIR (default ~/.claude/queue).
