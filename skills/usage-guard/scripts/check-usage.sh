#
# Reports the current Claude usage-window consumption by reading the queue
# skill's state file — refreshed (~every 10s) by statusline-wrapper.sh, which
# captures BOTH rolling windows: rate_limits.five_hour.* at the top level and
# rate_limits.seven_day.* under a `seven_day` sub-object. `--window 7d` guards
# the weekly cap; the default `5h` guards the 5-hour block.
#
# Exit codes let a caller branch without parsing floats:
#   0  = UNDER threshold (keep going)
#   10 = AT/OVER threshold (stop / queue)
#   1  = no state file (wrapper not wired in, or no render yet)
#   2  = data unavailable for the chosen window: no used_percentage (Pro/Max only,
#        after first API response — each window may be independently absent), OR a
#        resets_at already in the past (a self-contradictory reading — see below)
#   64 = usage error (bad flag / unknown --window value)
#
# CAPTURED_AGE_SEC is the staleness signal: large ⇒ the statusline isn't
# rendering and USED_PCT lags reality. A missing captured_at reports as very
# stale (not falsely fresh). STALE=yes|no applies the same >90s cutoff as
# compute-fire.sh, so both consumers of captured_at agree on one threshold.
#
# Config (env): QUEUE_STATE_DIR (default ~/.claude/queue), QUEUE_STATE_FILE (unset;
# set to pin a single legacy state file). State is keyed per session under
# state.d/ so another account's session can't poison this one — see resolve-state.sh.
