#!/usr/bin/env bash
# compute-fire.sh — emit a one-shot cron spec (local time) for /queue.
# macOS/BSD only: uses `date -r <epoch>` and `date -j -f` (GNU date differs).
#
# Modes:
#   (default, no args)   Fire ~90s AFTER the current usage window resets. Reads
#                        the chosen window's resets_at + the shared captured_at
#                        from the state file (kept fresh by statusline-wrapper.sh).
#                        Rounds up to a whole minute and DODGES :00/:30 — the
#                        minutes where CronCreate applies up-to-90s-EARLY jitter to
#                        one-shots — so it can never fire before the window
#                        actually resets. Flags STALE if the statusline hasn't
#                        rendered recently.
#
#   --window 5h|7d       Which rolling window's reset to target in reset mode
#                        (default 5h). `7d` reads .seven_day.resets_at so reset
#                        mode can fire after the weekly reset. Ignored with
#                        --epoch (an explicit target is window-agnostic).
#
#   --epoch <N>          Fire at the explicit local epoch N (a clock time / "in
#                        2h" / "10am tomorrow" the caller already resolved).
#                        Floored to the minute and honored; a sub-minute-FUTURE
#                        target bumps to the next whole minute (cron is
#                        minute-granular).
