#!/usr/bin/env bash
# statusline-wrapper.sh — taps the usage-window data into a state file, then
# renders the statusline.
#
# Claude Code pipes a JSON blob to the statusLine command on stdin. For Pro/Max
# subscribers it includes BOTH rolling windows under `rate_limits`:
# `five_hour.{resets_at,used_percentage}` and `seven_day.{resets_at,used_percentage}`
# — the moment each window flips and how much is consumed. That data is NOT
# available to anything running inside a session, so we capture it here from the
# one channel that carries it.
#
# Rendering: with no external statusline tool the built-in compact line is used,
# so these skills work standalone (no ccstatusline / bun required). Set
# QUEUE_STATUSLINE to forward stdin to any external renderer instead — e.g.
# QUEUE_STATUSLINE="bunx -y ccstatusline@latest" for ccstatusline.
#
# Config (env):
#   QUEUE_STATE_DIR    directory for state (default ~/.claude/queue). State is
#                      keyed per session under state.d/<session_id>.json so a
#                      session signed into a DIFFERENT account/plan can't
#                      overwrite this one's window data (issue #286).
#   QUEUE_STATE_FILE   pin a single legacy state file instead of per-session
#                      keying (unset by default; back-compat / tests).
#   QUEUE_STATUSLINE   external statusline command to forward stdin to; unset
#                      renders the built-in line.
# macOS/BSD `date` only (the built-in line uses `date -r <epoch>`).
