# Dispatch Protocol: Subagents Mode

Parallel task execution via Agent tool dispatches with worktree isolation. No experimental env var needed.

## Dispatch Implementers

For each task in the phase, check deps: `validate-plan --check-deps "$PLAN_JSON" --task {TASK_ID}`. Collect all tasks that pass. For each ready task, create a worktree and extract metadata (strip `status` — orchestrator state not needed by implementer):

```bash
git worktree add .claude/worktrees/{TASK_ID_LOWER} -b {TASK_ID_LOWER} HEAD
TASK_METADATA=$(jq -c --arg id "{TASK_ID}" '[.phases[].tasks[] | select(.id == $id)][0] | del(.status)' "$PLAN_JSON")
TASK_COMPLEXITY=$(echo "$TASK_METADATA" | jq -r '.complexity')
REVIEWER_NEEDED=$(echo "$TASK_METADATA" | jq -r '.reviewer_needed')
case "$TASK_COMPLEXITY" in
  low)    COMPLEXITY_GUIDANCE="Be efficient -- minimal implementation, avoid over-engineering." ;;
  medium) COMPLEXITY_GUIDANCE="Standard thoroughness -- test the happy path and key edge cases." ;;
  high)   COMPLEXITY_GUIDANCE="Think carefully -- consider edge cases, failure modes, and long-term maintainability." ;;
  *)      COMPLEXITY_GUIDANCE="Standard thoroughness -- test the happy path and key edge cases." ;;
esac
```

`TASK_COMPLEXITY` and `COMPLEXITY_GUIDANCE` are substituted into `{TASK_COMPLEXITY}` and `{COMPLEXITY_GUIDANCE}` in the implementer and reviewer prompts. `REVIEWER_NEEDED` gates reviewer dispatch in "Process Completions".

Then dispatch **all ready implementers in a single message** with multiple Agent tool calls — one per task. Splitting them across turns breaks parallelism and forces cache reloads for each agent.

```text
Agent(name: "impl-{TASK_ID_LOWER}", subagent_type: "claude-caliper:task-implementer", model: "{TASK_IMPLEMENTER_MODEL}", mode: "acceptEdits", prompt: "<substitute implementer-prompt.md, filling {TASK_COMPLEXITY}, {COMPLEXITY_GUIDANCE}, and all other {VARIABLES}>")
Agent(name: "impl-{TASK_ID_LOWER}", subagent_type: "claude-caliper:task-implementer", model: "{TASK_IMPLEMENTER_MODEL}", mode: "acceptEdits", prompt: "<substitute implementer-prompt.md, filling {TASK_COMPLEXITY}, {COMPLEXITY_GUIDANCE}, and all other {VARIABLES}>")
... (one per ready task)
```

The agent runs in background automatically (defined in agent frontmatter). Track each agent's name mapped to its task ID and worktree path.

**Note:** `--check-base` runs at orchestrate startup and before each phase dispatch (multi-phase). No separate dispatch-level base check is needed.

## Process Completions

When a background agent completes (push notification — do not poll):

1. Read the agent's return message for completion notes and task summary
2. Check `REVIEWER_NEEDED`:
   - If `"false"`: record a skip in reviews.json (`"verdict":"skip","reason":"reviewer_needed: false"`) and proceed directly to "After Review Passes" steps. Skip steps 3-4.
   - If `"true"`: dispatch a reviewer (synchronous — override background with `run_in_background: false` so the lead waits for results):

```text
Agent(
  name: "review-{TASK_ID_LOWER}",
  subagent_type: "claude-caliper:task-reviewer",
  model: "{TASK_REVIEWER_MODEL}",
  mode: "acceptEdits",
  run_in_background: false,
  prompt: "<substitute task-reviewer-prompt.md, filling {TASK_COMPLEXITY}, {COMPLEXITY_GUIDANCE}, and all other {VARIABLES}>"
)
```

3. Extract the last `json review-summary` block from reviewer output
4. Triage issues: "fix" or "dismiss" (with reasoning)

## Review Fix Cycle

If fixes needed, dispatch a new `claude-caliper:task-implementer` agent (with `mode: "acceptEdits"`) into the same worktree to apply fixes — the lead coordinates, implementers touch code.

1. Read the reviewer's findings
2. Dispatch a fix agent with the reviewer's findings and the task context, targeting the existing worktree path
3. When the fix agent completes, re-dispatch reviewer with updated HEAD_SHA
4. Repeat until review passes (max 3 cycles, then escalate to user)

## After Review Passes (or Skip)

When `reviewer_needed: false` in the task metadata, the review is skipped before reaching this point (recorded as `"verdict":"skip","reason":"reviewer_needed: false"`). All tasks reaching this section have passed review.

1. Record the task-review in `reviews.json` (in the plan directory alongside plan.json):
   ```bash
   jq '. += [{"type":"task-review","scope":"{TASK_ID}","verdict":"pass","remaining":0}]' "$PLAN_DIR/reviews.json" > "$PLAN_DIR/reviews.json.tmp" && mv "$PLAN_DIR/reviews.json.tmp" "$PLAN_DIR/reviews.json"
   ```
   To skip review: use `"verdict":"skip","reason":"<justification>"` instead of `"verdict":"pass"`.
   If `reviews.json` doesn't exist yet, create it: `echo '[]' > "$PLAN_DIR/reviews.json"` first.
2. Mark task complete: `validate-plan --update-status plan.json --task {TASK_ID} --status complete`
3. Validate criteria: `validate-plan --criteria plan.json --task {TASK_ID}`
4. Merge and clean up the agent's worktree:
   - Never `cd` into an agent worktree — always use `git -C <agent-worktree-path>` for inspection commands (`git log`, `git status`, `git diff`). This prevents CWD from pointing at a path that gets deleted during cleanup.
   - Merge: `git -C <your worktree path> merge <agent-branch>`
   - Clean up: `git worktree remove <agent-worktree-path>` then `git branch -d <agent-branch>`
   - Reset CWD after removal: `cd <feature-worktree-path> && pwd` — run this after every worktree removal even if you believe CWD hasn't drifted
5. Check if dependent tasks are now unblocked (`validate-plan --check-deps`)
6. Dispatch newly unblocked tasks (same pattern as above)

## Key Differences from Agent Teams

- No mailbox idle notifications (agent-teams concept) — use background agent completion events instead
- No mailbox messaging — lead dispatches fix agents into the existing worktree
- Worktrees are created by the orchestrator via `git worktree add` from the feature branch
- Fix agents are dispatched into existing worktrees — the lead coordinates, implementers touch code
