# Writing Plans

Write implementation plans assuming the executor has zero codebase context. Document everything: which files to touch, exact code, how to test, what to avoid and why.

**Context:** Runs after design approval. All needed context comes from the design doc.

**Save to:** `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>/plan-<topic>.md`

## Workflow

1. **Initialize tracking** — `TaskList` for prior session, `TaskCreate` for planning phases
2. **Explore codebase** — Understand patterns, find exact file paths
3. **Decide phasing** — Single vs multi-phase (see Phasing below)
4. **Write tasks** — Each task follows required structure
5. **Save plan** — Write to plan file with frontmatter
6. **Run plan review** — Dispatch reviewer, fix issues until clean
7. **Hand off to execution** — Report plan path to user

```

Write `design-doc: <path>` in frontmatter when a design doc exists. Downstream skills (plan-review, implementation-review) use this path to verify criteria coverage and fulfillment.

## Phasing

**Use multiple phases when:** dependency layers exist (Phase A creates things Phase B consumes), verification gates are needed, or phases ship independently.

**Stay single-phase when:** tasks are independent or share a linear chain with no natural cut points. Don't phase for phasing's sake. Single-phase plans still use A-prefix (A1, A2, etc.).

**Complexity gates:**
- **8+ tasks in a single-phase plan** — almost always has a hidden dependency boundary. Look for it before proceeding.
- **7+ tasks in any individual phase** — examine for cut points. Large phases make debugging harder.

**Phase boundaries** fall where "run full suite and verify" is meaningful. Each phase ends with a verification task and a one-sentence rationale explaining why it exists.

**Design doc inheritance:** If the design doc already has approved phases, use those as the starting structure. Don't contradict without flagging.

## Task Structure

Every task includes all fields below — missing any one means a fresh executor stalls or guesses wrong.

| Field | Requirement | Bad | Good |
|-------|-------------|-----|------|
| **Files** | Exact paths (create/modify/test) | "the auth files" | `src/auth/login.ts`, `tests/auth/login.test.ts` |
| **Verification** | Runnable command, <60s | "check that it works" | `pytest tests/auth/ -v` |
| **Done when** | Measurable end state | "authentication complete" | "login returns JWT, 4/4 tests pass" |
| **Avoid + WHY** | Pitfalls with reasoning | "don't use X" | "Use jose not jsonwebtoken — CJS/Edge issues" |
| **Steps** | TDD cycle per step | "add validation" | Write failing test, verify fail, implement, verify pass, commit |

Write complete code in each step — not "add validation" or "implement the handler." If the executor has to guess what the code looks like, the plan isn't specific enough.

**Interface-first ordering:** Define contracts first (embed in plan), implement against them in middle tasks, wire consumers last.

**First task as integration tests:** When cross-task data flow exists, the first task in a phase (e.g., A1) can be broad integration tests — the outer loop of double-loop TDD. Write end-to-end tests with stub imports that stay RED until the last piece lands. Skip for single-module changes with no cross-task data flow.

**Handoff note placeholders:** When a task consumes output from a prior phase, its task block starts with a handoff placeholder blockquote: `> **Handoff from A2:** [TBD — Phase A dispatcher fills in actual details after completing A2]`. The source phase's dispatcher fills this in with real outputs (function signatures, file paths, config keys) after completing the producing task.

### The Fresh Claude Test

> Could a fresh Claude with zero prior context execute this task without asking a single clarifying question?

Vague paths ("the auth files") or done-when ("authentication complete") fail this test. Exact paths and measurable outcomes pass.

## Plan Review Gate

After saving, dispatch plan-review before execution. Plans with issues get fixed and re-reviewed until clean.

**Gather:** `{PLAN_PATH}`, `{DESIGN_DOC_PATH}` (or "None"), `{REPO_PATH}`

**Dispatch:** Agent tool (general-purpose, model: "opus") with prompt from `skills/plan-review/reviewer-prompt.md`

Skipping review risks plans with missing paths or ordering bugs reaching execution where they're harder to fix.

## After Review Passes

Report the plan file path to the user. Run orchestrate in the main context where it can interact with the user for Rule 4 escalations and ship decisions.
