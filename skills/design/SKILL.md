# Design: Ideas Into Plans

Turn ideas into validated designs through collaborative dialogue before any code is written.

<HARD-GATE>
Do NOT invoke implementation skills, write code, or scaffold projects until you have presented a design and the user has explicitly approved it. Skipping design validation is the #1 cause of wasted work in AI-assisted sessions. This applies to EVERY project regardless of perceived simplicity.
</HARD-GATE>

## Anti-Pattern: "Too Simple to Need a Design"

A todo list, a utility function, a config change — all go through this process. "Simple" projects are where unexamined assumptions cause the most wasted work. The design can be a few sentences, but you must present it and get approval.

## Checklist

Complete in order:

1. **Explore context** — files, docs, recent commits
2. **Challenge assumptions** — question the framing before accepting it
3. **Ask clarifying questions** — smart batches (see below)
4. **Propose 2-3 approaches** — trade-offs and your recommendation
5. **Present design** — sections scaled to complexity, approval after each
6. **Set up worktree** — branch type depends on phase count (known from step 5 phasing discussion):
   - Multi-phase: `git worktree add -b integrate/<feature> .claude/worktrees/<feature>` — integration branch; phase worktrees created by orchestrate as siblings
   - Single-phase: `git worktree add -b <feature> .claude/worktrees/<feature>` — feature branch; orchestrate works here directly, PRs to main
   1. Bootstrap dependencies per **See:** ./dependency-bootstrap.md
   2. Run tests to establish a clean baseline
7. **Configure and approve** — single AskUserQuestion with 3 questions:

    **Q1 — Workflow** (header: "Workflow"):
    Check `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/caliper-settings get workflow` for the user's preferred default. Mark the matching option with "(default)":
    - **Create PR** — Orchestrate → pr-create
    - **Merge PR** — Orchestrate → pr-create → pr-review → pr-merge
    - **Plan only** — Stop after plan is reviewed

    **Q2 — Execution mode** (header: "Exec mode"):
    Check `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/caliper-settings get execution_mode` for the user's preferred default. Recommend based on design complexity (these override the setting when they differ):
    - ≤10 tasks AND single phase → recommend `Subagents`
    - >10 tasks OR multi-phase → recommend `Agent teams`

    Mark the recommended option with "(Recommended)" in its label. If the user's setting differs from the complexity recommendation, note both in the option labels.

    Options:
    - **Subagents** — Parallel Agent tool dispatches with worktree isolation. No special env var needed.
    - **Agent teams** — Parallel teammates with push notifications and mailbox messaging. Requires env var.

    **Q3 — Approval** (header: "Approval"):
    - **Approve design (auto turn on acceptEdits)**
    - **Needs changes**

    If "Needs changes" on Q3, return to step 5.

    **Agent teams fallback:** If user picks "Agent teams", check `$CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS`. If not `1`, use AskUserQuestion to explain: "Agent teams requires `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1`. To enable: run `echo 'export CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1' >> ~/.zshrc && source ~/.zshrc`, then restart Claude Code." Offer: "Continue with subagents" or "Stop (I'll restart with agent teams)". If they choose subagents, override the Q2 answer to `Subagents` before step 11 writes plan.json. If they stop, tell them the exact command to resume: `claude --continue` in the worktree directory.

    On approval, create sentinel: `mkdir -p <plan-dir> && touch <plan-dir>/.design-approved`
8. **Write design doc** — `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>/design-<topic>.md`, commit
9. **Dispatch design-review subagent** — fresh Opus agent validates design before planning (hard gate)
10. **Dispatch draft-plan subagent** — fresh Opus agent with design doc path and worktree path (zero design context)
11. **Route workflow** — Map step 7 choices to schema values:
    - Workflow: `Create PR` → `pr-create`, `Merge PR` → `pr-merge`, `Plan only` → `plan-only`
    - Exec mode: `Subagents` → `subagents`, `Agent teams` → `agent-teams`

    Write both: `jq --arg w "<workflow>" --arg e "<exec-mode>" '.workflow = $w | .execution_mode = $e' plan.json > tmp && mv tmp plan.json`

    For multi-phase plans, also write the integration branch name:
    `jq --arg ib "integrate/<feature>" '.integration_branch = $ib' plan.json > tmp && mv tmp plan.json`

    For **Create PR** or **Merge PR**: invoke orchestrate.
    For **Plan only**: run `scripts/validate-plan --check-workflow plan.json` to verify design-review and plan-review passed. Report the plan file path and stop.

```text
Agent(
  subagent_type: "general-purpose",
  model: "opus",
  prompt: "Review the design doc at docs/plans/<folder>/design-<topic>.md
    using the design-review skill.
    Working directory: .claude/worktrees/<feature>"
)
```

If design-review finds issues, present them to the user, collaboratively fix the design doc, and re-dispatch design-review until clean. Only dispatch draft-plan after design-review passes. After design-review passes, extract the `json review-summary` block from the final passing review and write a record to `{PLAN_DIR}/reviews.json` (initialize with `[]` if it doesn't exist): `jq --argjson entry '{"type":"design-review","scope":"design","iteration":N,"issues_found":N,"severity":{...},"actionable":N,"dismissed":N,"dismissals":[...],"fixed":N,"remaining":0,"verdict":"pass","timestamp":"<ISO8601>"}' '. += [$entry]' reviews.json > tmp && mv tmp reviews.json`

```text
Agent(
  subagent_type: "general-purpose",
  model: "opus",
  prompt: "Read the design doc at docs/plans/<folder>/design-<topic>.md and write
    an implementation plan using the draft-plan skill.
    Working directory: .claude/worktrees/<feature>"
)
```

After draft-plan returns, dispatch plan-review with the same review loop protocol:

```text
Agent(
  subagent_type: "general-purpose",
  model: "opus",
  prompt: "Review the plan at docs/plans/<folder>/plan.json
    using the plan-review skill.
    Design doc: docs/plans/<folder>/design-<topic>.md
    Working directory: .claude/worktrees/<feature>"
)
```

Extract the `json review-summary` block from the response. Triage issues (fix plan files or dismiss with reasoning). Read the threshold: `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/caliper-settings get re_review_threshold`. If actionable issues exceed this threshold, fix and re-dispatch reviewer (max 3 iterations, then escalate to user). Write review record to `{PLAN_DIR}/reviews.json`: `{"type":"plan-review","scope":"plan","iteration":N,"issues_found":N,"severity":{...},"actionable":N,"dismissed":N,"dismissals":[...],"fixed":N,"remaining":0,"verdict":"pass","timestamp":"ISO8601"}`


## Challenging Assumptions

Before clarifying questions, challenge the framing like a senior PM:

- "What problem does this solve, and for whom?"
- "What would users actually do with this?"
- "Is there a simpler alternative?"

**Example:** User: "All users should have public pages." Challenge: "A public page needs content to show. What would a non-creator put there?" — may surface that the feature isn't needed yet.

## Smart Question Batching

- **Text questions** (word-described choices): batch up to 4 per AskUserQuestion
- **Visual questions** (need ASCII mockups): one at a time, use `markdown` preview
- Text first, visual last
- Each question gets its own options — never "all correct / not correct" toggles
- Ambiguous concepts: explain the difference, offer interpretations as options

## Presenting the Design

- Scale sections to complexity (few sentences to 200-300 words)
- Ask after each section: "Does this look right?"
- Cover: architecture, components, data flow, error handling, testing
- Note shared foundations as **phasing candidates**

**Phasing** (after all sections):
- Simple: "Single phase, no dependency layers. Sound right?"
- Complex: "N dependency layers. Phase 1 — [name], Phase 2 — ... Adjust?"

Use AskUserQuestion with "Looks good" / "Adjust phases" options.

## Design Doc Contents

When writing the design doc (`docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>/design-<topic>.md`):
- Sections in order: Problem, Goal, Success Criteria, Architecture, Key Decisions, Non-Goals, Implementation Approach
- **Problem** — what's broken, who's affected, consequences of not solving
- **Success Criteria** — human-verifiable behavioral statements (not "tests pass"); collectively complete (all pass = goal met), individually necessary
- If multi-phase: **Implementation Approach** includes phase rationale
