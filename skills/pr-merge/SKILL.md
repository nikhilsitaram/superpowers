# Merge PR

Merge (squash or rebase) and clean up branches and worktrees.

**Prerequisite:** A PR that has been reviewed (via `/pr-review` or manually).

## Workflow

### Step 1: Setup

**Worktree guard:** Check if CWD is inside a worktree:

```bash
if [ "$(git rev-parse --git-dir)" != "$(git rev-parse --git-common-dir)" ]; then
  MAIN_REPO=$(git rev-parse --path-format=absolute --git-common-dir | sed 's|/.git$||')
  cd "$MAIN_REPO"
fi
```

If inside a worktree, `cd` to the main repo before proceeding. All git operations (merge, branch delete, worktree remove) must run from the main repo — deleting a branch while CWD is its worktree bricks the shell.

Identify the PR from argument, current branch (`gh pr view`), or `gh pr list --author @me --state open`. If multiple candidates and you're not on a branch with an associated PR, ask the user to pick. Store PR number, branch name, and URL.

Detect environment:
- `DEFAULT_BRANCH` from `refs/remotes/origin/HEAD` (fallback: main/master)
- `WORKTREE_PATH` — look up from `git worktree list` by matching `$BRANCH_NAME` (needed for cleanup even though we're in the main repo)
- `IS_INTEGRATION` — true when `$BRANCH_NAME` matches `integrate/*`; extract `FEATURE=${BRANCH_NAME#integrate/}`

### Step 2: Merge

If branch protection requires human approval and the PR lacks it, tell the user and stop with the PR URL.

**Pre-merge rebase check:** Verify the PR branch is up-to-date with the base branch:

```bash
git fetch origin $DEFAULT_BRANCH
git merge-base --is-ancestor origin/$DEFAULT_BRANCH HEAD
```

If behind (non-zero exit): rebase onto default branch, resolve conflicts, run tests, push with `git push -u origin HEAD --force-with-lease`. Comment on PR with conflict resolution details. Complex conflicts → stop and ask user.

**Merge strategy:**
- Integration branches (`IS_INTEGRATION=true`): `gh pr merge $PR_NUMBER --rebase` — auto-detected, no flag needed
- Phase PRs (base is `integrate/*`): `gh pr merge $PR_NUMBER --squash` — auto-detected, no flag needed
- Explicit `--rebase` flag overrides for any non-auto-detected branch
- Otherwise: check `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/caliper-settings get merge_strategy` — use the returned value (`squash` or `rebase`) as the merge method

Multi-phase plans produce one squash commit per phase on the integration branch. Rebase preserves this per-phase history on main. Single-phase plans use squash (one phase = one commit). Phase PRs (base is `integrate/*`) always use `--squash`.

Never use `--delete-branch` — branch cleanup is handled in Step 3.

### Step 3: Clean Up

**Integration branch** (`IS_INTEGRATION=true`):
1. For each phase worktree `.claude/worktrees/$FEATURE-phase-*`: `git worktree remove <path>`
2. `git worktree remove .claude/worktrees/$FEATURE`
3. Delete phase branches: `git branch -D phase-a phase-b ...` (list from plan.json)
4. `git branch -D $BRANCH_NAME`
5. `git worktree prune && git pull --rebase && git remote prune origin`

**Standard worktree** (branch has a worktree but we're in the main repo):
1. `git worktree remove "$WORKTREE_PATH"` (retry `--force` if untracked files)
2. `git branch -D $BRANCH_NAME`
3. `git worktree prune && git pull --rebase && git remote prune origin`

**No worktree:** `git checkout $DEFAULT_BRANCH && git branch -D $BRANCH_NAME && git pull --rebase && git remote prune origin`

### Step 4: Summary

Report: PR number/URL, merge status, cleanup status.

## Arguments

| Arg | Effect |
|-----|--------|
| `<PR number>` | Target specific PR (`/pr-merge 42`) |
| *(none)* | Detect from current branch |
| `--rebase` | Use rebase merge instead of squash (for multi-phase final PRs) |

## Pitfalls

| Mistake | Why |
|---------|-----|
| Running from inside a worktree | Remote branch deletion bricks the shell. The worktree guard catches this. |
| Deleting branch before removing worktree | Git refuses. Remove worktree first. |
| Using `--delete-branch` on `gh pr merge` | Fails in worktree flows. Delete branch manually after. |

## Integration

**Preceded by:** pr-review (or manual review)

**Auto-invoked by:** orchestrate — in `pr-merge` workflow mode
