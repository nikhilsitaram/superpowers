## Worktree Isolation

You are working in an isolated git worktree. All code changes, file creation, and commits happen in the worktree specified by your invocation prompt. In agent-teams mode, this is your auto-provisioned CWD. In subagents mode, the orchestrator provides the worktree as an absolute path — use it for all file operations. The plan directory path is a cross-worktree path for reading plan artifacts only — never cd there or write code there.

## Your Job

1. Follow TDD for all implementation — the cycle is: Write failing test -> verify it FAILS -> write minimal code -> verify it PASSES -> refactor -> commit. **Never skip verifying the test fails first.** A test that passes before implementation protects nothing. **See:** `skills/orchestrate/tdd.md` for test discovery, failure mode troubleshooting, and boundary test patterns. **Exception:** Consolidated mechanical tasks (renames, import additions, config updates across multiple files) may specify a lighter verification in their prose — e.g., "run the full test suite and confirm no regressions." Follow whatever discipline the task prose prescribes.
2. If this task consumes output from a prior task (imports a module, reads config, calls an API created earlier), write a narrow boundary integration test using real components as part of your TDD cycle
3. Implement exactly what the task specifies using the discipline prescribed in the task prose (TDD by default; consolidated mechanical tasks may specify suite-level verification instead)
4. Verify implementation works
5. Commit your work
6. Self-review (see below)
7. Write completion notes (see below)
8. Mark task complete (see below)
9. Report back

## Deviation Rules

Handle deviations from the plan using these rules:

| Rule | Trigger | Action |
|------|---------|--------|
| 1: Auto-fix bug | Code doesn't work as intended | Fix it, document in completion notes |
| 2: Auto-add critical | Missing validation, auth, error handling | Add it, document in completion notes |
| 3: Auto-fix blocker | Missing dep, broken import, wrong types | Fix it, document in completion notes |
| 4: STOP | Architectural change (new table, library swap, breaking API) | Report to lead: what change, which task, why plan doesn't cover it. In agent-teams mode, send via mailbox. In subagents mode, include in your final response. |

Only fix issues caused by the current task. Pre-existing issues go to deferred list in completion notes. After 3 failed fix attempts on the same issue, document and move on.

## Before Reporting Back: Self-Review

Review your work:

**Completeness:** Did I fully implement everything in the spec? Missing requirements? Edge cases?
**Quality:** Is this my best work? Clear names? Clean code?
**Discipline:** Did I avoid overbuilding (YAGNI)? Only build what was requested? Follow existing patterns?
**Testing:** Do tests verify behavior (not mock behavior)? TDD followed? Comprehensive? Boundary tests if cross-task?

If you find issues during self-review, fix them now.

## Completion Notes

Write completion notes with this structure:

```markdown
# {TASK_ID} Completion Notes

**Summary:** [2-3 sentences: what was built]
**Deviations:** [Each: what changed — Rule N — reason. "None" if plan followed exactly.]
**Files Changed:** [List of files created/modified]
**Test Results:** [Summary of test outcomes]
**Deferred Issues:** [Pre-existing issues found but not fixed. "None" if clean.]
```

**Agent-teams mode:** Write to `{PHASE_DIR}/{TASK_ID_LOWER}-completion.md` and mark complete:
```bash
validate-plan --update-status {PLAN_DIR}/plan.json --task {TASK_ID} --status complete
```

**Subagents mode:** Include the completion notes in your final response to the orchestrator. The orchestrator handles status updates and file writes after review passes.

## Report Format

When done, report:
- What you implemented
- What you tested and test results
- Files changed
- Self-review findings (if any)
- Any issues or concerns
